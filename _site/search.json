    "text": "Trade\n\n\nAustralia’s Economic Resilience Amid China’s Slowdown.\n\n\nMacro • Micro • Institutions\n\n\n\n  \n     \nI want to look at what's going on with China's economy right now. Why does it matter? Because China buys nearly a third of everything Australia sells overseas. It's the main destination for Australian coal, iron ore, and gold. \nThe slowdown has been getting attention from economists and policymakers around the world. China consumes a massive amount of energy and resources, so when their growth decelerates, it sends ripples through global markets. For Australia, which depends heavily on selling resources to China, this is worth paying close attention to.\n\n\nAustralian exports to China have traditionally been dominated by resources and energy: iron ore, natural gas, gold. But as China's middle class grows, we are starting to see more diversity: premium agricultural products, financial services, healthcare, aged care, and professional services are all becoming part of the mix.\nThe numbers tell the story. China surpassed $326.9 billion as Australia's largest two-way trading partner in 2023, still accounting for nearly a third of Australian exports. Australia shipped $218.8 billion worth of goods and services to China in 2023, up 18.2% from the year before. Services exports jumped 53.4% in the same period, mostly because tourists and international students started coming back after the pandemic.\n\n\nInvestment flows both ways too. By 2021, two-way investment between Australia and China reached $166.8 billion. China was the 8th largest foreign direct investor at $92 billion in Australia, while Australian investment in China stood at $74.8 billion. Chinese investment here has moved beyond just mining into infrastructure and healthcare.\n\n\nOver the past decade, China has been trying to shift towards a more market-oriented system. The People's Bank of China has loosened its grip on the yuan, letting it move more with market forces instead of being tightly controlled. Interest rates have been liberalised to make the financial system more responsive. They have also been pushing hard to attract foreign investment in high-tech sectors, and have become a major player in technology, anti-trust regulation, and the electric vehicle industry.\n\n\nBut there are real problems underneath the surface. China's debt-to-GDP ratio has blown past 300%, which is alarmingly high by any standard. A lot of this debt sits with local governments and state-owned enterprises, and it raises serious questions about whether their growth model can keep going. \n\nInside China's Economy\n\nHere's how it happened: local governments were tasked with hitting aggressive GDP targets. To drive growth, they went on building sprees: highways, apartment blocks, entire cities. The problem is that many of these developments never attracted residents or businesses. You have probably heard about China's \"ghost cities\", huge urban areas that sit mostly empty. These assets do not generate returns, and they have become a drag on local government finances, adding to the debt pile. \n\nThe Three Red Lines Policy \n\nIn 2020, Beijing tried to get the debt situation under control with something called the Three Red Lines policy. It set strict limits on how much property developers could borrow, based on three financial ratios: debt to cash, debt to equity, and debt to liabilities. The idea was to rein in the property sector's excessive borrowing.\nIt worked - maybe too well. Developers suddenly could not access the funding they needed. Construction slowed. Liquidity dried up. The property sector, which had been a major engine of growth, started sputtering. This has contributed to disinflation, where prices rise more slowly. There's even talk of deflation, which is particularly nasty when you're carrying a lot of debt because profits shrink while your repayments stay the same.\nThe Demographic Challenge\nChina's one-child policy, which started in 1979, is now coming back to bite them. There simply aren't enough young people entering the workforce. The population is aging fast, and the demographic that typically drives consumption, people aged 20 to 45, is shrinking as a share of the total.\nYoung couples are not having kids. The economic pressures are too intense, and many are already stretched thin supporting elderly parents. This has forced China to lean more heavily on exports to drive growth, which makes them more dependent on trading partners at exactly the moment when tariffs and protectionist policies are on the rise globally.\nA Tough Business Environment\n\nChinese companies are navigating some choppy waters. The government's deleveraging push, combined with tariffs on Chinese goods from overseas, has created a lot of uncertainty. Defaults are a real risk, especially in property where debt levels are highest. And there's growing concern in Western countries that continued trade with China might be propping up an economic model that doesn't play by the same rules.\nThe bottom line: China has made real progress reforming its economy, but the high debt, demographic decline, and reliance on exports create genuine risks for its stability going forward.\nWhat This Means for Australia\n\nRelations between Australia and China got pretty rocky in recent years. China hit Australia with a series of trade restrictions on exports. But with the current Labor government, things have improved on the diplomatic front, and some of the economic pressure has eased.\nWhat's interesting is that despite the trade tensions, Australia's economy proved surprisingly resilient. The trade surplus actually hit record levels during the worst of it. A big part of this was Australia’s ability to find other buyers. When China blocked barley and wine, Australia redirected exports to Southeast Asia and found new markets like the UK. When they stopped taking Australia coal, Australia sold more to Japan and South Korea. By 2023, as relations improved, China started importing Australian coal again.\n\nIron Ore: The Linchpin\nIron ore is still the big one. It accounts for roughly 60% of Australian total exports to China, driven by their steel industry. Yes, the property market there has taken a hit, but demand for steel for infrastructure and industrial purposes is holding up. Given the scale of China's infrastructure projects and their overall GDP, iron ore demand should stay strong even as their growth rate moderates.\n\nAustralia navigated the short-term trade tensions reasonably well, but the long-term risks of depending so heavily on iron ore exports to China haven't gone away. If China significantly cuts steel production or shifts away from iron ore for environmental reasons, that would hit Australian trade balance hard. There's also more competition in the global iron ore market to contend with.\nThe good news is that Australia has been diversifying into new markets and new sectors like renewable energy and other commodities. That should help cushion any future shocks.\nThe Australia-China trade relationship has had its ups and downs, but Australia’s ability to adapt and find alternative markets has kept it stable. Still, with iron ore so dominant and China's economic policies shifting, Australia need to stay alert and keep building those alternative pathways.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    © 2024 The Thinking Nerd — All thoughts my own."
