  <h1>Iran at the Threshold of Transition</h1>

  <p>Iran has entered a phase that once belonged to political imagination rather than expectation. The protests that have spread across the country recently are not simply a response to currency collapse or economic hardship. They reflect a deeper exhaustion with a system that has failed across political, social, environmental, and economic dimensions. The crowds returning to the streets are not demanding adjustment or reform. They are confronting finality.</p>
  
<p>  For years, the Islamic Republic survived on a familiar claim: it could impose order, deter threats, and keep Iran out of catastrophic war. That claim is now increasingly difficult to sustain, not only because of domestic collapse, but because the regime’s regional strategy has been materially weakened. For decades, the Islamic Republic survived by offering a simple bargain. Authoritarian rule in exchange for security. Ideological governance in exchange for protection from war. That bargain has now collapsed. Iran’s leadership claimed that its regional strategy would keep conflict away from Iranian cities. Yet in June, Israeli missiles struck Tehran and other urban centres directly. The idea of invulnerability, carefully cultivated since the end of the Iran–Iraq War, dissolved almost overnight.</p>

  <p>This breakdown is inseparable from the erosion of Iran’s regional position. The regime’s forward defence doctrine relied on projecting power through allied militias across the Middle East. Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, Iraq, and Yemen were meant to serve as buffers. Over the past two years, that architecture has come under sustained pressure. Israeli operations have not eliminated Iran’s proxies, but they have degraded leadership networks, disrupted logistics, and raised the cost of maintaining regional deterrence. The result is strategic exposure. The weaker the proxy network becomes, the more Iran itself is drawn into direct confrontation.</p>
 
 <p>At the same time, the wider Middle East is changing in ways that further isolate Tehran. Across much of the Gulf, the political priority has shifted toward stability, economic reform, and state-led development. National transformation agendas depend on predictability and security. This has reduced tolerance for ideological confrontation and proxy warfare, even where diplomatic engagement with Iran continues. Anti-Iranian sentiment has hardened within parts of the Gulf security establishment, particularly in Riyadh, where Iran is still viewed through the lens of missiles, militias, and long-term strategic competition. Qatar remains something of an exception, maintaining diversified relationships while relying heavily on external security guarantees. But the broader regional direction is clear. The Middle East is reorganising around state capacity, not revolutionary symbolism.</p>


  <p>Iran’s claim to be a regional shield is also being undermined by Sunni extremist violence, particularly linked to ISIS-Khorasan and the rise of Taleban in Afghanistan, has emerged as a growing threat across the region. This exposes a further illusion. Proxy networks and ideological posturing do not provide protection against transnational extremism. Nor do they guarantee internal security. Attacks linked to extremist groups have already struck Iranian territory, reinforcing the sense that the state can neither contain threats abroad nor fully protect its own population.</p>


  <p>These regional shifts matter because they shape domestic political consciousness. For decades, Iranian opposition politics was fragmented. Reformists, monarchists, abolitionists, and loyalists disagreed not only on outcomes but on whether collapse was even possible. That assumption has now changed. What once seemed unimaginable has entered the realm of plausible futures. Iranians at home and across the diaspora are moving beyond arguments about what they oppose toward debates about what must come next. A political transition now appears inevitable, though its form remains uncertain. Several scenarios remain on the table. A renewed external agreement could impose change from within. Succession might produce a new leadership while preserving core structures. A consolidation by the Revolutionary Guards could bring short-term order at the cost of legitimacy and heightened external conflict. Each of these paths implies transformation, yet each also attempts to salvage a system that has grown fundamentally disconnected from society.</p>

  <p>This is why a fourth scenario has gained momentum. A transition that emerges outside the Islamic Republic’s institutional framework altogether. When political opposition is banned and leadership is suppressed, legitimacy shifts to the streets. In that context, leadership is no longer optional. It becomes necessary. Recognition, visibility, and the ability to articulate a transitional roadmap acquire political weight, regardless of personal histories or ideological disagreements. Iran is not without capacity. Many of its institutions predate the Islamic Republic and remain resilient. Public services have not collapsed. Human capital remains extensive, both inside the country and across the diaspora. Yet the risks are real. Secessionist movements on Iran’s periphery, regional instability, and the interests of foreign powers all threaten a fragile transition. Sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable. Any political future that fails to protect them will lack legitimacy from the outset.</p>

  <p>The greatest danger ahead is not collapse itself. It is an unmanaged transition. Disorder would invite internal coercion, external interference, and long-term fragmentation. If the Islamic Republic’s political project is ending, then the central task is not to celebrate its demise but to protect what comes after it.</p>
