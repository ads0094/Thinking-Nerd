  <p> My interests mainly lie in economics, geo-politics and applied statistics. My work sits between theory and practice, with a focus on how models are used in real settings where uncertainty, data limitations, and human judgement matter as much as technical skill.

I hold a bachelor’s degree in economics and a master’s degree in business analytics. I am interested in working in the field of economics, and in pursuing further study in statistics over time.

This blog is where I document what I am learning and work through questions about economics, data, and decision-making. It is a record of ideas, arguments, and problems I am still trying to understand.

I host the Forecasting Impact Podcast, exploring forecasting applications across industry and academia.</p>
